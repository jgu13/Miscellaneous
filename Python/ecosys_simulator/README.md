### Ecosystem_simulator.py

This is a tool that simulates a 10*10 $km^2$ ecosystem that composed of lions and zebra.

Both species are able to move, eat and reproduce. 

Simulation duration is by default set to 20 times, during which we let the ecosystem evolve and plot a population of lion and population of zebra over time.
